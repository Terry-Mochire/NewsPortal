## NEWS PORTAL API

### Description


A REST API for querying and retrieving scoped news and information for a hypothetical organisation.
There should be news/articles/posts that are available to all employees without navigating into any department, and others that are housed/classified within departments.
This was a project as a student at Moringa School to practice with building REST APIs, testing them with Postman, many-to-many database relationship, custom exceptions and Error handling.
